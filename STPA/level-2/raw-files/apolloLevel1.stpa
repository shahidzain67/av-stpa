                Apollo mistakenly believes that the human driver has taken control	[BEL-44]		678
                    Type 1 scenario: Inadequate control algorithm / hardware	[CS-14]		679
                        Algorithm flaw: Apollo automatically drops to human control (automatic off) without the human's knowledge or instruction	[FB-93]		680
                            [How is not required here]	[HOW-10001]		960
                                Apollo must be programmed to stop in a safe location and apply the parking brake at the end of the journey	[REQ-48]		961
                    Type 1 scenario: Inadequate control algorithm / hardware	[CS-14]		681
                        Apollo does not account for the end of the test period and apply brakes (either a standard continuous brake command, or a transition to ‘Park’ mode)	[FB-94]		682
                            [How is not required here]	[HOW-10001]		962
                                Apollo must be programmed to stop in a safe location and apply the parking brake at the end of the journey	[REQ-48]		963
                Apollo mistakenly believes it is supplying sufficient brake	[BEL-45]		683
                    Type 2 Scenario: Apollo receives incorrect feedback / information:	[CS-2]		684
                        Information such as the local angle of the road (relative to the vertical action of gravity) is either not fed back to the process model, or it is not taken into account	[FB-95]		685
                    Type 1 Scenario: Controller receives correct feedback but interprets it incorrectly or ignores it:	[CS-1]		686
                        Information received: Feedback is sufficient to determine that the vehicle is on a hill	[FB-96]		687
                            Apollo does not account for the enhanced braking requirement	[HOW-107]		688
                                Apollo must account for gradient when applying the brakes	[REQ-77]		950
                            The specific local gradient is rejected in favour of the map gradient	[HOW-108]		690
                                Apollo must use the local gradient, rather than the map gradient, when applying the brakes when stationary	[REQ-78]		951
        CA-6.22: Apollo stops applying brake control when collision occurs and driver has not resumed control (e.g. manual braking)	[UCA-6.22]	[H-1] [H-2] [H-3] [H-4] [H-5] 	672
            True statement from UCA context: The vehicle has been brought to rest, but the vehicle drops out of automatic mode following a collision - leaving the vehicle free to move on e.g. a hill, or if further collisions take place	[TRUE-37]		677
                Apollo mistakenly believes that the human driver has taken control	[BEL-46]		691
                    Type 1 scenario: Inadequate control algorithm / hardware	[CS-14]		692
                        Algorithm flaw: The control state transitions to human control mode	[FB-97]		693
                            Following a collision and being brought to rest, automatic mode is simply ended without 'Park' being engaged	[HOW-109]		694
                                Apollo must be programmed to stop in a safe location and apply the parking brake at the end of the journey	[REQ-48]		952
                            The collision and associated trajectory change are misinterpreted as a human override, leading to drop out of automatic mode	[HOW-110]		695
                                Apollo must bring the vehicle to rest and apply the parking brake after a collision	[REQ-52]		953
                            The algorithm attempts to slow down to avoid a collision, but the algorithm does not recognise a post collision scenario, and therefore simply carries on going	[HOW-111]		696
                                Apollo's collision sensors must still be capable of reporting a collision even when extensive damage to the vehicle has taken place	[REQ-50]		964
                                Apollo must be capable of detecting less severe collisions that do not immediately threaten life but require immediate attention, such as a broken windscreen, loose exhaust, etc	[REQ-51]		965
                                Apollo must bring the vehicle to rest and apply the parking brake after a collision	[REQ-52]		954
