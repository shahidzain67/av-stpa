    <td class="tg-0pky">The SD does not know Estop has to be provided when manual override is not effective<br>  a) â€¦ Inaccurate information was spread during driver training, e.g.: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;# that the Safety Driver 2 does never have to provide an E-Stop command and only Safety Driver 1 does)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;# that Estop should only be provided in emergency situations when a collision is imminent<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;# that an Estop triggers a hold on the vehicle that can only be removed by a maintenance station and therefore the SD is hesitant to use the Estop<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) ... Safety Driver was taught to press a different button to trigger E-Stop during training (e.g. button relocated, etc.)<br> b) ... Estop button (with respective layout) was used to replace a button for a different function during assembly and was never replaced so SD presses the Estop button but gets a different function<br> b) ... SD was taught to only press the E-Stop button after being instructed by Safety Driver 1 and SD1 does not give that instruction (e.g. does not remember, was never taught to do so, etc.)<br> c) ... the SD's (internal) model of how to operate the vehicle or the SD's responsibiliities have changed  <br>     ... SD was taught to press the E-Stop button only for a short period of time which was correct at the time of training. However, later SW changes require the button to be pressed for more than x seconds to trigger E-Stop<br>     ... from the experiences the SD had when driving the autonomous vehicle it has often proved to be more useful to not provide an Estop and just to prevent a stronger (more percentage) override<br></td>
    <td class="tg-xldj">In order to test the limits of the autonomous software (and maybe the necessity of Estop) the SD were told not to make use of Estop at all<br><br>SD were told not to make use of E-Stop during testing when there is attention by the press</td>
