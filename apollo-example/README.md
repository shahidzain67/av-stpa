# WIP: Finding out about Apollo

Here we are aiming to investigate the trustability (including safety) of
the [Apollo project](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) which is
made available by Baidu under the Apache 2.0 License.

Considering safety specifically, we'll be attempting to apply STPA, on
Apollo release v2.0.0
